					I feel hungry all the time. <br>
					Eating feels like eating air. <br>
					The urge to chew. Or to run.<br>
					There was something between my ears, inside the skull, something  un-satisfied. <br>
					 <br>

					There is a lot of sound all around. <br>
					A lot of sound wherever I go <br>
					I cannot hear my own self<br>
					I need to consume to drown out the sound <br>
					<br>
					When reading <br>
					When reading <br>
					In the very moment of reading <br>
					You cannot be seeing anything else.<br> 
					<br>
					<br>
					The juggling of senses 
					And sound feins to remain in the background

					
					This moment in the world has so sound.<br>
					The air is vibrating ash and sweat and smoke from cars in harmony with the horns. <br>
					<br><br>
					To think one wants to come back to an aural home. 
					That would be something. <br>
					And aurality and temperature have a lot to do with each other. <br> <br>
					<br>
					It is hot in goa right now. 
					There is familiarity in this heat. 
					But there is a lot more sound than before.
					

					Last few days in bangalore.
					I found some silence in the avalahalli forest. 
					That silence was wonderful. 

					Silence is a priveledge. 
					
					Not the silence inside a souind proof room
					Like holding your breath. 

					A floating breathing silence. 
					In search of a floating breathing silence.

					Goa- mapusa, vagator, corjuem. 
				

					<i>One can only produce sound. To produce and showcase silence in an exhibition would mean something. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Making of no sound. But being together in no sound. not alone silence. Breathing silence. </i>
