            Puneet:<br>
            They fetch one word. To predict a word that comes after that one word.. to do that what they are doing is —<br>
            If we take a word, the words around it found in a greater count, have more chances of being predicted. 
            They vectorise each word into n numbers. Say the word king is represented with 5 numbers - -1.2, 2.4.. etc- it is initialised in this way. The word to vector algorithm is in-itself pretty amazing. <br>
            <br>
            So just imagine a 5-dimensional vector ‘king’ floating around in 5-d space that is constantly updating/iterating. In the final iteration, it exists somewhere in the 5-d space. In this way, ‘man’, ‘queen’ etc are all floating around in 5-d sapce. If you remember, A vector + B vestor = C vecotor, ok?
            <br><br>
            Sultana : Yes
            <br><br>
            Puneet: so now what’s happening in this algorithm, these iterations are on the basis of two things - ‘what is the word?’ ‘What are the contextual words around it?’

            In ‘I live in Delhi’, the word ‘live’ has words on the left and right- contextual words-- on the basis of which it is updating.  <br>
            So now, what they did is
            KING - MAN  + QUEEN . This will yield a vector with 5numbers.
            And that vecotor was ‘WOMAN’
            <br><br>
            Sultana: No way!!
            <br><br>
            (Laughter on both sides)
            <br><br>
            Puneet: In our childhood, we used to do this - <br>
            KING:MAN :: QUEEN : ? <br>
            Thats what this algorithm is doing. <br>
            This is amazing, yes. But what I find mathematically amazing..
            (pause)  
            ok this is hard to explain-///
