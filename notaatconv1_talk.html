            Everything was so clear and mysterious before the world was divided into smaller distinctive parts to understand it better. And after generations of breaking it into smaller parts, each part developed its own language and no one could talk to anyone anymore.

            One has always taken things for granted and he knows it. However some are so simple, hidden in the plain sight – one of them what we call ‘space’. For years people have debated over this subject. Can we call it a subject? Let me explain through questions, they always make things easier.<br>
            Are you in space right now? If no, think again. If yes, how do you know it? Are you able to have a sensorial relationship with space right now? Just like you touch a table, grab a charger can you do the same with a space right now. Can you pinch a space if I tell you to do so? 
            If you say it is there, it always has been there, can you lend me a part of that space to me? Can you pull a space and put it into another space.
            That brings me to the question – is the space bounded? Let alone is it finite, infinite? Where is the horizon?
            Even if you are able to answer all of this, I am sure you were thinking of space which is outside your identity. We always have been fond of our internal and external. We have always made divisions. I want you to come with me and understand a space which is bounded by your imaginations and can be unbounded when you start exploring it.
            You see a screen. You see some images. A light source emits light and light falls on the screen, reflects towards you and through many discrete phenomenon image forms on your retina. The image formed is stuck in a plane on the retina. Can you see that image? Can you imagine that image? How do you see that image? Isn’t that crazy? Surely, someone is there to see that image. Come a little far from that image on the retina. Yes a little bit more. Can you now see the person staring at the image on the retina? Thank god now we know who sees the image on the retina? But wait! Who sees the person staring at the image on the retina? Let me rephrase. You see the image on the screen which is formed on the retina. You can see/imagine the image on the retina, a person sees the image on the retina and there is one more person who has to be there who can see the first person staring at the image on the retina. Can those people see you as well? How long can you imagine such persons in the space? Where is that space? How long? Where is has the time gone in searching for this space? <br><br>
