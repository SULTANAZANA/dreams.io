					Mushrooms every morning. <br>
					The queens out in the front. <br>

					Dangerous people said. But the wasps never cared. <br>
					<br>	
					But not when I first came in. <br>
					Not at all. There was nothing before.<br>
					We grew together. 	<br>
					The house and me.<br>
					I ate my house and it ate me. <br>

  				<p>What is a house? <br>
  					<br>

					Once you are inside<br> 
					You stop existing just within your body <br>
					The house becomes the body <br>
					And the mind is within the body at home <br>
					You are inside your own mind now <br>
					<br>
					that is the thing anyway - the more we live in it - the more it becomes us - and we become it.<br>
					When you are alone, inside your home, inside your mind,<br>
					Anything happens all the time <br>
					What they call thoughts<br>
					<br>
					Everything spills in and out of us. <br>
					Its all over the place. Spread out. <br>
					We clean it. We clean our mind. <br>
					<br>
					Sometimes we learn to live inside our mind.<br>
					like<br>
					While travelling. While being in jail. <br>
					While being in hostels. Or Sharing rooms. <br>
					<br>
					Nothing outside. Sterile. <br>
					Everything contained. <br>
					But then it spills out all the time. Carefully inside the boundaries of notebooks.<br>
					It spills, it is contained, and we keep keeping it.<br>

					Alongside is the passing of time <br>
					
					<br> <br>
					Outside the house, time is a narrow path <br>
					ticking past at the edge of the hand <br>
					Balancing the acts of conversation and being <br>
					Tightrope till we reach home <br>


					go back inside.<br> 
					Be all spilled out <br> 
					And then time need not be a narrow path.<br> <br>
					Time is all over the place.<br> 
					Nothign is fixed if one is truely at home. <br>
					The limits of what is fixed have nothing to do with the outside. mostly. <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					i just need some space. <br>
					and time. <br><br>
					Though<br> sometimes I feel lost <br>
					when there is a lot of time around me. <br>
					Had I been born in a tribe<br>
					Time would have been different. <br>
					I have no home now.<br>
					sometimes I find it. <br>
					for short bursts of time <br>
					on a bit of land. <br>
					and I sit there under the sun <br>
					imagining gravitational waves passing right through me<br>
					the thing that truely excites me <br>
					is being the shrodinger's cat<br>
					<br><br>
					Is anybody home?
