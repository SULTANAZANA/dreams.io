                This music is not owned by respective artists. These playlists are to share with friends and family. It is the music I have been listening for years and music I recently found and music someone gave me.  <br><br> 
                Instructions: Download the zip file. There will probably be some ads that you need to ignore. (Its a free service.) Unzip it using 7Zip(free) or unarchiver (mac). And that's it. There is all the songs in there.
